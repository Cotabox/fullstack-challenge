# Documentation

1. It's one solution for Cotabox Fullstack Challenge (read more bellow).

2. This challenge was partially solved based on:
- Angular "Tour of Heroes" tutorial (read more bellow)
- "Fundamentals" (ex. Reactive Forms) in the Angular Documentation
- Ng2-charts module, that uses Chart.js library

3. Considering the basic "CRUD" of data is one of the most basic and important skills of any developer, independendant of the programming language that you are using, I've done an abstraction, an analogy with the "Heroes" with the "Employees" or any kind "User"

4. Considering that I have a deadline to deliver this challenge, I'm going to work on it until the deadline, so this documentation will be modified until it's date and, maybe, after this date too if I decide to continue to improve its solution to this challenge just to learn more, eventhought I don't be the selected candidate.

5. To run this Angular App in a development server, just clone this repository localy and **follow general instructions for any Angular app**:

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# { "developer": "fullstack" }

The objective of this challenge is to evaluate your domain in fullstack development: its organization, style and good practices with code, APIs creation, frameworks knowledge and technologies.

## Rules

1. Your code should be made available in a public or private repository, on your personal github or bitbucket. But, if you preffer, create a Pull Request with your application;
2. Send the link to desenvolvimento@cotabox.com.br;
3. We use VueJS and Node.js with MongoDB, but you can feel free to choose other technologies;

## Challenge

### Front-end

The following layout should be developed
![layout](layout-onepage.png)

[You can download the PSD here](layout-onepage.psd)

- You can use the libs and frameworks that make you more comfortable;
- All fields are required in the form;
- We'll be happy if you develop tests for it;

### Back-end

The layout has a form, a table with percentage information of participation and a pizza graph that represents this distribution.

- You need to create APIs that sends and receives these informations;
- We'll be happy if you develop tests for it;
- In case of inconsistency, return the error in a structured JSON with HTTP 400 code;

#### Plus

Feel free to make improviments like new funcionalities, visual optimizations, API security, etc. ðŸ˜‰

## Questions?

Send your questions directly to desenvolvimento@cotabox.com.br or opening a issue.

# AngularTourOfHeroes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
