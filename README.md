# Documentation

1. It's my parcial solution for Cotabox Fullstack Challenge (read more bellow).
2. I'm trying to solve this challenge after studied Angular "Tour of Heroes" tutorial (read more bellow), because I think it's possible to use an analogy with "heroes" and "employees / investors" hence the way to do the basic "CRUD" is almost the same in most cases.
3. I'm still working on this challenge until the deadline, scheduled for 07/21/2020, so, this documentation will be modified until it's date.
4. To run this Angular App in a development server, just clone this repository localy and follow general instructions for any Angular app:
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# { "developer": "fullstack" }

The objective of this challenge is to evaluate your domain in fullstack development: its organization, style and good practices with code, APIs creation, frameworks knowledge and technologies.

## Rules

1. Your code should be made available in a public or private repository, on your personal github or bitbucket. But, if you preffer, create a Pull Request with your application;
2. Send the link to desenvolvimento@cotabox.com.br;
3. We use VueJS and Node.js with MongoDB, but you can feel free to choose other technologies;

## Challenge

### Front-end

The following layout should be developed
![layout](layout-onepage.png)

[You can download the PSD here](layout-onepage.psd)

- You can use the libs and frameworks that make you more comfortable;
- All fields are required in the form;
- We'll be happy if you develop tests for it;

### Back-end

The layout has a form, a table with percentage information of participation and a pizza graph that represents this distribution.

- You need to create APIs that sends and receives these informations;
- We'll be happy if you develop tests for it;
- In case of inconsistency, return the error in a structured JSON with HTTP 400 code;

#### Plus

Feel free to make improviments like new funcionalities, visual optimizations, API security, etc. ðŸ˜‰
